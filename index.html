            <h2>The Unmistakable Sound of Oasis</h2>
            <p>Oasis was an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Initially known as the Rain, the group rose to prominence in the mid-1990s as a leading act of the Britpop movement. With their anthemic rock songs, swaggering attitude, and well-publicized sibling rivalry between primary songwriters Noel Gallagher and lead singer Liam Gallagher, Oasis became one of the most successful and influential bands of their era.</p>
            <p>Their sound was characterized by catchy melodies, powerful guitar riffs, and Liam's distinctive vocal delivery. They achieved massive commercial success, selling over 75 million records worldwide and scoring numerous number-one singles and albums.</p>
